‚ùå Problem: Violation of SOLID (Tightly Coupled Code)
üî¥ Violation:
The Analytics logic and Marketing logic are mixed in the same class. Any change by Marketing (e.g., tracking campaigns) affects Analytics.
üî¥ Violated Principle:
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) ‚Äì one class is doing too many things.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ‚Äì the class must be modified for new marketing requirements.



‚úÖ Solution: Apply SOLID Principles
‚úÖ Fix: Use SRP and OCP
Separate Analytics, Marketing, and Ad Serving logic.
Use interfaces or composition to extend behavior.


bad code example:
class AdManager {

    public void serveAd(String adType) {
        System.out.println("Serving Ad: " + adType);

        // Analytics logic
        trackImpression(adType);

        // Marketing logic (bad: mixed here)
        if (adType.equals("Video")) {
            System.out.println("Start campaign tracking for Video Ad");
        }
    }

    private void trackImpression(String adType) {
        System.out.println("Logging analytics for: " + adType);
    }
}
